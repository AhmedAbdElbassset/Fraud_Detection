## Introduction:-
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection using the Bank fraud dataset from NeurIPS 2022. The dataset contains transactional data from a bank, labeled with binary indicators of whether each transaction was fraudulent or not. As we all know, fraud is a persistent problem in many industries, causing a huge financial loss, Dange to the reputation of the affected businesses, legal consequences and a lot more. The purpose of this project is to develop a robust fraud detection system that can quickly identify and prevent fraudulent activities before they cause significant harm.

## Motivation:-
The motivation of this Task lies in the potential consequences of the fraudulent activities. Fraud as we said can lead to a huge financial loss, Dange to the reputation of the affected businesses and legal consequences. Additionally, businesses must consider the ethical amplification of failing to prevent or detect fraud. So, a robust fraud detection system can help prevent these negative outcomes by quickly identifying and flagging potential fraud cases, protecting both the business and its customers.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

## DataSet
[Kaggel] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022) - dataset 

In 2022, the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) datasets were released at NeurIPS. 
There are six different datasets that mimic bank account fraud

we use dataset consist of The base dataset and its five variants include:
   - 1 million data instances each
   - 32 features
